# Problem Identification
Social media for news utilization is a double edged blade. First, its low cost , easy access and
rapid circulation of information lead people to absorb news. Second, it enables the broad
spread of ‘fake news’ i.e. news with purposely wrong information.

Therefore, Fake News detection has recently become an emerging research that is
attracting considerable attention. Fake news detection presents unique characteristics and
issues that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media. Fake news is
deliberately written to mislead readers to believe false information.
